## Current Work
- Preparing configuration files for production use
- Testing the memory bank system
- Validating task template workflows

## Next Steps
- Implement a sample project using the template
- Test the agent activation workflow
- Validate all command triggers 
- Create sample tasks to demonstrate functionality
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for a test project
- Create comprehensive testing plan

## Issues & Risks
- Need to validate that all agent trigger keywords work as expected
- Need to ensure template files follow consistent formatting

## Milestones
- [x] Memory bank initialization
- [ ] Project requirements definition
- [ ] Architecture design (CI/CD pipeline partially defined)
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Initial code structure (CI/CD configuration exists)
