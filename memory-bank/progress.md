# Project Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank directory structure created and refreshed (June 2, 2025)
- Core memory bank files reestablished with proper hierarchical relationships:
  - `projectbrief.md` (foundation document)
  - `productContext.md` (builds on projectbrief)
  - `systemPatterns.md` (builds on projectbrief)
  - `techContext.md` (builds on projectbrief)
  - `activeContext.md` (builds on product, system, and tech context)
  - `progress.md` (builds on activeContext)
- Hierarchical file dependencies maintained during recreation
- Memory bank structure follows the defined patterns

## In Progress
- Verifying memory bank file loading and context retention after recreation
- Validating agent interaction patterns with refreshed memory bank
- Implementing workflow triggers for memory bank updates
- Aligning cross-functional team processes with memory bank structure

## What's Left to Build
- Additional context folders (features, integrations, api, testing, deployment)
- TDD workflow implementation
- Integration testing between memory bank and agent framework
- Documentation on memory bank maintenance procedures
- User guides for effective memory bank usage

## Current Status
**Overall**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
- Memory Bank: ðŸŸ¢ Implemented and Refreshed
- Agent Framework: ðŸŸ¡ Defined but needs testing
- Workflow Integration: ðŸŸ  Partially implemented
- TDD Implementation: ðŸ”´ Not started

## Known Issues
1. **Memory Bank Updates**: Need to verify that updates properly propagate through the hierarchy after recreation
2. **Agent Triggers**: Need to test that agents engage based on defined triggers with refreshed memory bank
3. **Workflow Integration**: Memory bank updates need to be integrated with task workflows

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully cleaned and recreated hierarchical memory bank structure
- Maintained proper file dependencies during recreation
- Updated content to reflect current project state

## Next Priorities
1. Verify memory bank loading and context retention after recreation
2. Validate agent interactions with refreshed memory bank
3. Implement TDD workflow patterns
4. Create documentation for memory bank maintenance
