# Project Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank directory structure created
- Core memory bank files established with proper hierarchical relationships:
  - `projectbrief.md` (foundation document)
  - `productContext.md` (builds on projectbrief)
  - `systemPatterns.md` (builds on projectbrief)
  - `techContext.md` (builds on projectbrief)
  - `activeContext.md` (builds on product, system, and tech context)
  - `progress.md` (builds on activeContext)
- Global rules updated to reflect memory bank hierarchy
- Agent roles and permissions defined in `.windsurfrules`

## In Progress
- Testing memory bank file loading and context retention
- Validating agent interaction patterns with memory bank
- Implementing workflow triggers for memory bank updates
- Aligning cross-functional team processes with memory bank structure

## What's Left to Build
- Additional context folders (features, integrations, api, testing, deployment)
- TDD workflow implementation
- Integration testing between memory bank and agent framework
- Documentation on memory bank maintenance procedures
- User guides for effective memory bank usage

## Current Status
**Overall**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
- Memory Bank: ðŸŸ¢ Implemented
- Agent Framework: ðŸŸ¡ Defined but needs testing
- Workflow Integration: ðŸŸ  Partially implemented
- TDD Implementation: ðŸ”´ Not started

## Known Issues
1. **Memory Bank Updates**: Need to verify that updates properly propagate through the hierarchy
2. **Agent Triggers**: Need to test that agents engage based on defined triggers
3. **Workflow Integration**: Memory bank updates need to be integrated with task workflows

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully implemented hierarchical memory bank structure
- Updated global rules to align with desired memory system
- Created all core memory bank files with proper dependencies

## Next Priorities
1. Test memory bank loading and context retention
2. Validate agent interactions with memory bank
3. Implement TDD workflow patterns
4. Create documentation for memory bank maintenance
