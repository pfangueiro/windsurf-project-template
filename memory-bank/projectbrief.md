# Project Brief

## Overview
This is the foundation document for the Windsurf Project Template, establishing core requirements, goals, and scope. All other memory bank files build upon this document.

## Project Mission
To create a standardized, efficient template for Windsurf IDE projects that supports multi-agent workflows and maintains comprehensive project context through an enhanced memory bank system.

## Core Goals
1. Establish a robust memory bank system with hierarchical file organization
2. Support multi-agent collaboration through clear role definitions
3. Implement efficient task management workflows
4. Provide clear documentation and context maintenance
5. Enable TDD (Test-Driven Development) workflows

## Key Stakeholders
- Development team
- Product managers
- QA specialists
- Documentation specialists
- Project users

## Scope Boundaries
### In Scope
- Memory bank structure and maintenance
- Agent role definitions and permissions
- Task and workflow management
- Documentation standards
- TDD implementation patterns

### Out of Scope
- Specific application business logic
- External integrations beyond template needs
- Custom UI components beyond template demonstrations

## Success Metrics
- Complete memory bank hierarchy functioning correctly
- All defined agents able to collaborate effectively
- Task creation and management functions according to specification
- Documentation stays in sync with development
