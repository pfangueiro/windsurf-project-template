# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently implementing and refining the memory bank system for the Windsurf Project Template. The goal is to establish a robust, hierarchical documentation structure that maintains project context across sessions and supports multi-agent collaboration.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `global-rules.md` to reflect the hierarchical memory bank structure
- Created core memory bank files following the defined hierarchy
- Established file dependencies and relationships
- Fixed structure to match original design intent

## Next Steps
1. Complete implementation of all core memory bank files
2. Test the memory bank system to ensure proper loading and context retention
3. Align agent roles and workflows with the memory bank structure
4. Implement cross-functional team processes as defined in `.windsurfrules`
5. Document TDD workflow patterns for development tasks

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Structure
**Decision**: Implement hierarchical memory bank with `projectbrief.md` as foundation
**Rationale**: This structure provides clear dependencies and context flow between documents
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flat file structure (rejected due to lack of clear relationships)
- Database storage (rejected for complexity and reduced portability)

### Agent Framework
**Decision**: Define agents with explicit roles, permissions, and triggers
**Rationale**: Clear boundaries prevent role confusion and enable appropriate collaboration
**In Progress**: Validating agent interaction patterns with new memory bank structure

### Documentation Update Workflow
**Decision**: Establish explicit triggers for memory bank updates
**Rationale**: Ensures documentation stays current and consistent
**Open Question**: How frequently should automated checks for update needs occur?

## Key Considerations

### Memory Consistency
We must ensure that hierarchical updates flow correctly through the memory bank. When updating foundational documents (like `projectbrief.md`), we need to verify that dependent documents remain consistent.

### Agent Collaboration
The cross-functional team structure needs testing to verify that agents engage appropriately based on defined triggers and respect permission boundaries.

### Workflow Integration
The memory bank update workflow needs to integrate smoothly with task management and TDD workflows.
