# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently implementing and refining the memory bank system for the Windsurf Project Template. The goal is to establish a robust, hierarchical documentation structure that maintains project context across sessions and supports multi-agent collaboration.

## Recent Changes
- Cleaned and recreated the memory bank structure (June 2, 2025)
- Reestablished core memory bank files following the defined hierarchy
- Ensured file dependencies and relationships are maintained
- Updated documentation to reflect current project state

## Next Steps
1. Verify proper loading and context retention of the recreated memory bank
2. Align agent roles and workflows with the memory bank structure
3. Implement cross-functional team processes as defined in `.windsurfrules`
4. Document TDD workflow patterns for development tasks
5. Create additional context folders for specialized documentation

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Structure
**Decision**: Maintain hierarchical memory bank with `projectbrief.md` as foundation
**Rationale**: This structure provides clear dependencies and context flow between documents
**Status**: Implemented and verified through recreation process

### Agent Framework
**Decision**: Define agents with explicit roles, permissions, and triggers
**Rationale**: Clear boundaries prevent role confusion and enable appropriate collaboration
**In Progress**: Validating agent interaction patterns with refreshed memory bank structure

### Documentation Update Workflow
**Decision**: Establish explicit triggers for memory bank updates
**Rationale**: Ensures documentation stays current and consistent
**Status**: Implemented with periodic verification procedures

## Key Considerations

### Memory Consistency
We must ensure that the recreated memory bank maintains hierarchical consistency. When updating foundational documents (like `projectbrief.md`), we need to verify that dependent documents remain consistent.

### Agent Collaboration
The cross-functional team structure needs testing with the refreshed memory bank to verify that agents engage appropriately based on defined triggers and respect permission boundaries.

### Workflow Integration
The memory bank update workflow needs to be validated with the recreated structure to ensure smooth integration with task management and TDD workflows.
