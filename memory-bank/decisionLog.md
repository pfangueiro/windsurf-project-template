## Decisions

### [2025-05-28 16:34:10] - Implement Advanced Memory System

#### Context
Review of memory system options and evaluation of different approaches to maintain project context and enhance agent performance.

#### Decision
Implement the comprehensive memory system with workflow diagrams, event handlers, function maps, and advanced error recovery mechanisms.

#### Rationale
The advanced system provides better structure, more robust error handling, clearer organization, and sophisticated self-improvement mechanisms compared to alternatives.

#### Implications
- Enhanced context retention across sessions
- More resilient error handling and recovery
- Better documentation and project organization
- Systematic approach to implementation and evaluation

#### Alternatives Considered
- Simpler memory bank structure with basic file organization
- No structured workflows or event handlers
- Manual error handling rather than systematic recovery
