- **Title**: Brief descriptive title
- **Status**: Decided, Implemented, Superseded, or Revisiting
- **Context**: Background and drivers for the decision
- **Decision**: The specific choice made
- **Rationale**: Reasoning behind the decision
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

- **Related Decisions**: Cross-references to related decisions

## Decisions

### 2025-06-02-01: Memory Bank Hierarchical Structure

**Status**: Implemented

**Context**:  
The project requires a robust way to maintain context across sessions and support multi-agent collaboration. Various documentation approaches were considered.

**Decision**:  
Implement a hierarchical memory bank with `projectbrief.md` as the foundation document, with clear dependencies between files.

**Rationale**:  
A hierarchical structure provides clear relationships between documents, ensures consistent updates, and makes it easier to navigate and understand the project context.

**Alternatives**:
- Flat file structure (rejected due to lack of clear relationships)
- Database storage (rejected for complexity and reduced portability)
- Wiki-based system (rejected for dependency management challenges)

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clear documentation flow, consistent updates, better context preservation
- Negative: Requires discipline to maintain hierarchical updates
- Negative: Slightly more complex than flat structures

**Related Decisions**:
- 2025-06-02-02: Memory Bank Cleaning and Recreation

### 2025-06-02-02: Memory Bank Cleaning and Recreation

**Status**: Implemented

**Context**:  
Memory bank needed to be refreshed to ensure consistency and clean state.

**Decision**:  
Perform full cleaning and recreation of the memory bank system while preserving the hierarchical structure.

**Rationale**:  
Creating a clean memory bank ensures no inconsistencies or outdated information remains, while providing an opportunity to verify the integrity of the memory system.

**Alternatives**:
- Incremental updates (rejected due to potential for lingering inconsistencies)
- Partial recreation (rejected for potential hierarchy breaks)

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clean, consistent memory system
- Positive: Verified hierarchical structure
- Negative: Required effort to recreate all documents
- Negative: Potential for information loss (mitigated by backup)
