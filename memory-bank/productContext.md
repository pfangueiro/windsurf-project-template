# Product Context

## Project Purpose
The Windsurf Project Template serves as a foundation for building structured, well-documented projects with the Windsurf IDE. It addresses the need for maintaining context across sessions and facilitating multi-agent collaboration.

## Problems Solved

1. **Context Loss:** 
   - Traditional IDEs lose project context between sessions
   - Developers waste time rebuilding mental models
   - Project knowledge exists only in individual team members' minds
   
2. **Collaboration Friction:**
   - Unclear agent roles and responsibilities
   - Lack of standardized workflows
   - Inconsistent documentation practices
   
3. **Knowledge Silos:**
   - Critical decisions undocumented
   - Architecture and patterns not explicitly captured
   - Technical constraints not centralized

## Solution Approach

The template implements:

1. **Structured Memory Bank:**
   - Hierarchical documentation system
   - Clear file dependencies
   - Required core files with defined purposes
   
2. **Agent Framework:**
   - Explicit role definitions (BA, PM, Architect, PO, etc.)
   - Clear permission boundaries
   - Trigger-based engagement
   
3. **Workflow Definitions:**
   - Task creation and management processes
   - TDD workflow integration
   - Documentation update triggers

## User Experience Goals

1. **Seamless Context Retention:**
   - Memory bank maintains project state across sessions
   - New team members can quickly understand project structure
   - Critical decisions and rationale preserved
   
2. **Efficient Collaboration:**
   - Agents engage at appropriate times
   - Cross-functional teams work with clear boundaries
   - Knowledge transferred efficiently
   
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load:**
   - Documentation stays current automatically
   - Patterns recognized and codified
   - System becomes more helpful over time

## Key Differentiators

- Integration of memory system and agent roles
- Hierarchical documentation with clear dependencies
- Trigger-based workflows for maintenance
- Balance between structure and flexibility
