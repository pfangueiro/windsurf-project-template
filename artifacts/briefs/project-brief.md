# Project Brief: Windsurf Project Template

## Overview
The Windsurf Project Template provides a comprehensive project structure template for AI-assisted software development. It establishes a standardized framework that facilitates efficient collaboration between humans and AI throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Problem Statement
Modern software development projects lack consistent structures for AI agent collaboration, leading to fragmented context, inefficient knowledge transfer, and inconsistent documentation practices. There's a need for a standardized template that supports AI-assisted development while maintaining best practices for project management and documentation.

## Objectives
- Establish a comprehensive project structure that supports AI-assisted development
- Implement a memory bank system for persistent context tracking across sessions
- Define specialized AI agent roles with clear responsibilities and workflows
- Create standardized templates for all project artifacts
- Enable structured task management and tracking
- Facilitate cross-functional team collaboration with AI agents

## Target Users
- Software development teams working with AI assistants
- Project managers coordinating AI-augmented teams
- Organizations implementing AI-assisted development practices
- Individual developers leveraging AI for software projects

## Key Features
- Memory Bank System: Persistent context tracking across sessions
- Agent-Based Development: Specialized AI agents for different roles
- Comprehensive Templates: Standardized templates for all project artifacts
- Organized File Structure: Clear conventions for document organization
- Version Control Integration: Git-ready structure for collaborative development
- CI/CD Configuration: Ready-to-use CI/CD pipeline templates
- Agent Collaboration Model: Automatic agent engagement based on context
- Task Management Workflow: Structured approach to task creation and tracking
- Cross-Functional Teams: Pre-defined teams for different development phases

## Success Criteria
- All core memory bank files function properly
- AI agents can be triggered and perform their specialized roles
- Task creation and management workflows operate smoothly
- Templates are available for all required project artifacts
- Cross-functional teams can collaborate effectively
- Project context is maintained across multiple sessions
