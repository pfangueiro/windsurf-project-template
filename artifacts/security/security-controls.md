## Document Information
- **Project Name:** Windsurf Project Sample  
- **Document Version:** 1.0  
- **Date:** 2025-05-14  
- **Author:** Security Engineer

## Authentication Controls

### Password Policy
- **Implementation:** Enforce password complexity through a policy requiring:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Password history of 12 (prevent reuse of the last 12 passwords)
  - Maximum age of 90 days
  - Minimum age of 1 day

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Implementation:** Implement TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) as a second factor
  - Use RFC 6238-compliant TOTP algorithm
  - Support for authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy)
  - Provide backup codes for recovery
  - Required for all administrative functions and sensitive operations

### Account Lockout
- **Implementation:** Implement progressive lockout mechanism
  - 5 failed attempts: 30-second delay
  - 10 failed attempts: 5-minute lockout
  - 15 failed attempts: 30-minute lockout
  - 20 failed attempts: Account locked until admin reset

## Authorization Controls

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Implementation:** Implement RBAC with the following roles:
  - User: Basic access to application features
  - Editor: User permissions plus content management
  - Admin: Editor permissions plus user management
  - System: Admin permissions plus system configuration

### Permission Management
- **Implementation:** Create a permission management system with:
  - Granular permissions mapped to API endpoints and UI elements
  - Permission groups to simplify administration
  - Role-permission matrix for easy visualization
  - Audit logging for permission changes

### Principle of Least Privilege
- **Implementation:** 
  - Default all new accounts to User role
  - Require approval workflow for role elevation
  - Time-bound elevated privileges with automatic expiration
  - Regular review of user permissions

## Data Protection Controls

### Data Encryption at Rest
- **Implementation:**
  - Use AES-256 for database field-level encryption
  - Store encryption keys in a separate key management system
  - Implement key rotation procedures
  - Encrypt all sensitive data fields (PII, credentials, etc.)

### Data Encryption in Transit
- **Implementation:**
  - Use TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
  - Configure secure cipher suites
  - Implement certificate pinning for mobile applications

### Sensitive Data Handling
- **Implementation:**
  - Mask sensitive data in logs and UI displays
  - Implement data retention policies
  - Secure data deletion procedures
  - Data classification according to sensitivity

## Input Validation Controls

### API Input Validation
- **Implementation:**
  - Server-side validation for all inputs
  - Schema-based validation using JSON Schema
  - Strong typing and input constraints
  - Reject invalid inputs with appropriate error messages

### Client-Side Validation
- **Implementation:**
  - Implement as usability enhancement only
  - Always duplicate validations server-side
  - Use modern form validation libraries
  - Provide immediate feedback to users

### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Implementation:**
  - Use parameterized queries exclusively
  - Implement ORM with prepared statements
  - Avoid dynamic SQL generation
  - Apply least privilege to database accounts

## Output Encoding Controls

### XSS Prevention
- **Implementation:**
  - Context-appropriate output encoding
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
  - Use modern framework XSS protections
  - Regular security scanning for XSS vulnerabilities

### API Response Sanitization
- **Implementation:**
  - Sanitize all data returned in API responses
  - Remove sensitive information from error messages
  - Implement proper JSON serialization
  - Use response schemas to validate output

## Communication Security Controls

### API Security
- **Implementation:**
  - Use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for authentication
  - Implement JWT for authorization with proper signing
  - Use short-lived access tokens with refresh capabilities
  - Implement proper CORS configuration

### Session Management
- **Implementation:**
  - Create secure session tokens with sufficient entropy
  - Set secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie attributes
  - Implement session timeout (15 minutes of inactivity)
  - Allow users to view and terminate active sessions

## Logging and Monitoring Controls

### Security Event Logging
- **Implementation:**
  - Log all authentication events (success/failure)
  - Log all authorization decisions
  - Log all administrative actions
  - Include necessary context without sensitive data

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Implementation:**
  - Implement real-time alerting for suspicious activities
  - Create dashboards for security events
  - Set up automated responses for common attack patterns
  - Establish escalation procedures

## Implementation Guidelines

- All security controls must be reviewed by Security Architect before implementation
- Follow secure coding guidelines during implementation
- Use approved security libraries and frameworks
- Document all security control implementations

## Testing Guidelines

- Create specific security test cases for each control
- Perform both positive and negative testing
- Include security controls in automated test suites
- Conduct regular penetration testing
