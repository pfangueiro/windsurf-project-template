# Threat Model: Authentication System

## Overview

**Date Created:** 2025-05-14  
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-14  
**Owner:** Security Architect  
**Version:** 1.0

## System Description

### Component Purpose
The Authentication System manages user authentication, including login, registration, password reset, and session management.

### Data Flow Diagram
```
[User] ---> [Login Page] ---> [Authentication API] ---> [User Database]
                 ^                    |
                 |                    v
                 |        [Session Management Service]
                 |                    |
                 +--------------------+
```

### Trust Boundaries
- Web Browser to Authentication API (External)
- Authentication API to User Database (Internal)
- Authentication API to Session Management Service (Internal)

### Assets
- User credentials (username, password)
- Session tokens
- Personal information (email, name)
- Authentication logs

## Threat Analysis

### STRIDE Analysis

| Threat Category | Threat Description | Affected Component | Risk Rating | Mitigation |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Spoofing | Attacker impersonates a legitimate user | Login Page, Authentication API | High | Implement MFA, captcha, rate limiting |
| Tampering | Modification of authentication data in transit | All communication channels | Medium | Use TLS for all communications |
| Repudiation | User denies performing an action | Authentication API | Medium | Comprehensive logging of all authentication events |
| Information Disclosure | Leakage of credentials or personal data | Authentication API, User Database | High | Encryption at rest, proper access controls |
| Denial of Service | Authentication service unavailability | Authentication API | Medium | Rate limiting, scaling, redundancy |
| Elevation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized access | Authentication API | High | Proper role-based access control |

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Rating System
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Likelihood**: Very Likely, Likely, Possible, Unlikely
- **Overall Risk**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

### Prioritized Threats

| ID | Threat | Risk Rating | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|----|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| TH-1 | Brute force password attacks | High | Implement account lockout, rate limiting, strong password policy | Planned |
| TH-2 | Session hijacking | High | Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies, short session timeouts | Planned |
| TH-3 | SQL injection in authentication | High | Use parameterized queries, input validation | Planned |
| TH-4 | Cross-site scripting (XSS) | Medium | Content Security Policy, input sanitization, output encoding | Planned |
| TH-5 | Man-in-the-middle attacks | Medium | Enforce HTTPS with HSTS | Planned |

## Security Controls

### Preventive Controls
- Strong password policy enforced
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries for database access
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Detective Controls
- Comprehensive authentication logging
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Session tracking
- Anomaly detection for login patterns
- Real-time alerting for suspicious activities

### Responsive Controls
- Automated account lockout after suspicious activities
- Session invalidation capabilities
- Incident response procedures
- User notification for suspicious activities

## Assumptions and Limitations

- This threat model assumes the database server is secured according to organizational standards
- The model does not address physical security threats
- Third-party authentication providers, if used, will maintain their own security controls
