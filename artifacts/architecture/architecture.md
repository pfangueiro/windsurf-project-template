# System Architecture

## Overview
The Windsurf Project Template system is designed as a modular, agent-based architecture that facilitates AI-assisted software development. The architecture supports memory persistence, cross-functional team collaboration, and standardized workflows for development tasks.

## Architecture Principles
- **Memory Persistence**: Context maintained across sessions via memory bank
- **Agent Specialization**: Distinct AI roles with specific responsibilities
- **Workflow Standardization**: Consistent task management and development processes
- **Documentation-Driven**: Documentation as a first-class artifact
- **Template-Based**: Standardized templates for consistency
- **Version Control Friendly**: Structure optimized for Git-based workflows
- **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline configuration templates included

## System Components

### Memory Bank System
The memory bank is the central nervous system of the architecture, responsible for maintaining project context across sessions.

#### Key Components:
- **activeContext.md**: Tracks current session state and goals
- **productContext.md**: Defines overall project scope
- **progress.md**: Documents work status
- **decisionLog.md**: Records key decisions
- **systemPatterns.md**: Documents recurring patterns

#### Memory Flow:
```
User Input → Context Extraction → Memory Bank Update → Agent Integration
```

### Agent System
The architecture implements a multi-agent system where each agent has specialized knowledge and responsibilities.

#### Agent Components:
- **Agent Instructions**: MD files defining agent behavior and knowledge
- **Knowledge Base**: References to templates and documentation
- **Triggers**: Keywords that activate specific agents
- **Task Permissions**: Defined capabilities for task creation/review

#### Agent Interaction Flow:
```
Trigger → Agent Activation → Knowledge Access → Task Execution → Memory Update
```

### Task Management System
A structured approach to task creation, tracking, and completion.

#### Task Components:
- **Task Templates**: YAML templates for different task types
- **Task Storage**: Active and completed task directories
- **Task Workflow**: Creation → Execution → Review → Completion
- **Task Reports**: Generated completion reports

### CI/CD Integration
Ready-to-use CI/CD pipeline configurations for common platforms.

#### Pipeline Components:
- **Lint & Code Quality**: Static analysis and formatting
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and system tests
- **Build**: Application build process
- **Deployment**: Staging and production deployment

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: User provides input that triggers system components
2. **Context Processing**: Input processed to update memory bank
3. **Agent Activation**: Relevant agents engaged based on context
4. **Task Management**: Tasks created, executed, and tracked
5. **Documentation**: Auto-updated based on activity
6. **Code Integration**: Changes committed through version control
7. **CI/CD Processing**: Automated validation and deployment

## System Interfaces

### User Interfaces
- Command-line triggers for agent activation and workflow commands
- File-based interaction through project structure
- IDE integration for seamless workflow

### Internal Interfaces
- Memory bank file structure for context persistence
- Agent instruction files for behavior definition
- Template system for standardized artifacts

### External Interfaces
- Version control system integration (Git)
- CI/CD platform support (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Documentation generation systems

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: v18 for JavaScript components
- **Python**: v3.10 for Python components
- **Markdown**: Documentation and memory bank
- **YAML**: Configuration and task definitions
- **Shell Scripts**: Automation utilities

## Security Considerations
- Version control best practices
- CI/CD security scanning
- Credential management recommendations

## Deployment Architecture
For projects using this template, a standard deployment architecture is included:

### Environments
- **Development**: Local developer environments
- **Staging**: Pre-production validation
- **Production**: Live application environment

### Deployment Flow
```
Code Commit → CI/CD Pipeline → Validation → Staging → Production
```

## Scaling Considerations
The architecture is designed to scale from small individual projects to larger team collaborations by:

- **Modular Structure**: Components can be extended or customized
- **Template Extensibility**: Templates can be adapted for specific needs
- **Agent Flexibility**: New agents can be added for specialized roles

## Future Architecture Evolution
- Enhanced agent collaboration mechanisms
- Deeper IDE integration for real-time feedback
- Expanded CI/CD templates for additional platforms
- Advanced analytics on project progress and quality
