# Product Requirements Document

## Document Information
- **Project Name**: Windsurf Project Template
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date Created**: 2025-05-14
- **Author**: Windsurf Team

## Overview
The Windsurf Project Template product provides a comprehensive structure for AI-assisted software development. It establishes a standardized framework that combines human expertise with AI capabilities to improve development efficiency, consistency, and quality throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Problem Statement
Modern software development teams face several challenges when incorporating AI assistants into their workflows:
- Fragmented context across sessions leads to inefficient knowledge transfer
- Inconsistent documentation practices reduce team productivity
- Lack of standardized workflows for AI collaboration creates inconsistency
- Project knowledge is often siloed and difficult to maintain
- No clear process for engaging specialized AI capabilities for different development roles

The Windsurf Project Template addresses these challenges through a structured approach to AI-assisted development.

## Target Users
- Software development teams working with AI assistants
- Project managers coordinating AI-augmented teams
- Organizations implementing AI-assisted development practices
- Individual developers leveraging AI for software projects

## Product Goals
1. Establish a robust framework for AI-assisted development
2. Implement persistent context tracking across development sessions
3. Define clear roles and responsibilities for AI agents
4. Provide standardized templates for all project artifacts
5. Create efficient task management workflows
6. Enable seamless collaboration between human developers and AI agents
