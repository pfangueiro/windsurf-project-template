## Deliverable Review Status

| Deliverable | Status | Reviewer | Comments |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Formal Requirements Specification | Complete | Business Analyst | All sections completed and reviewed |
| Use Case Documentation | Complete | Product Owner | All primary use cases documented |
| Security Requirements Document | Complete | Security Architect | Security requirements aligned with threat model |
| Initial Threat Model | Complete | Security Architect | STRIDE methodology applied to key components |
| Requirements Traceability Matrix | Complete | Business Analyst | All requirements mapped to business needs |

## Exit Criteria Assessment

| Exit Criterion | Status | Evidence | Comments |
|----------------|--------|----------|----------|
| All requirements are documented | Met | Requirements Specification Document | 127 functional and 43 non-functional requirements documented |
| All requirements have acceptance criteria | Met | Requirements Specification Document | Each requirement has defined acceptance criteria |
| All security requirements are documented | Met | Security Requirements Document | 35 security requirements documented and reviewed |
| All requirements are approved by stakeholders | Met | Stakeholder Sign-off Document | All key stakeholders have signed off |
| Requirements are testable | Met | Requirements Review | QA has verified testability of requirements |
| Requirements are prioritized | Met | Requirements Specification Document | All requirements categorized as Must/Should/Could/Won't |

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------------|--------|------------|------------|
| RISK-01 | Some security requirements may be difficult to implement within timeline | High | Medium | Early prototyping of complex security controls, potential scope adjustment |
| RISK-02 | Integration requirements with legacy systems may be incomplete | Medium | Medium | Additional analysis of legacy system interfaces, schedule technical spike |
| RISK-03 | Performance requirements may conflict with security requirements | Medium | Low | Balance analysis with Security Architect and Performance Engineer |

### Risk Management Actions
1. Schedule technical spike for legacy system integration in design phase
2. Conduct security control implementation feasibility assessment
3. Schedule joint review between security and performance teams
4. Develop contingency plans for high-risk requirements

## Security Assessment

### Security Review Results

| Security Requirement | Status | Reviewer | Comments |
|----------------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Authentication Requirements | Met | Security Architect | MFA requirements properly specified |
| Authorization Model | Met | Security Architect | RBAC model properly defined |
| Data Protection Requirements | Met | Security Architect | Encryption requirements properly specified |
| Secure Communication | Met | Security Architect | TLS requirements properly documented |
| Audit and Logging | Met | Security Architect | Comprehensive logging requirements defined |

### Security Actions
1. Ensure threat model is updated when design phase introduces new components
2. Schedule security architecture review early in design phase
3. Identify any security requirements that need prototyping

## Quality Assessment

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Requirements Clarity (1-5) | ≥ 4 | 4.3 | Met |
| Requirements Completeness (1-5) | ≥ 4 | 4.1 | Met |
| Security Requirements Coverage (%) | ≥ 95% | 98% | Met |
| Stakeholder Approval (%) | 100% | 100% | Met |
| Requirements with Acceptance Criteria (%) | 100% | 100% | Met |

### Quality Actions
1. Monitor any requirement changes through formal change control process
2. Schedule regular reviews of requirements during design phase

## Issues and Action Items

| ID | Description | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|--------|
| AI-01 | Create detailed technical specifications for security controls | Security Architect | 2025-05-21 | Open |
| AI-02 | Refine performance requirements with more specific metrics | Performance Engineer | 2025-05-20 | Open |
| AI-03 | Schedule technical spike for legacy system integration | Project Manager | 2025-05-16 | Open |

## Gate Decision

- [x] **Approved** - All exit criteria met, proceed to next phase
- [ ] **Conditionally Approved** - Proceed to next phase with action items
- [ ] **Not Approved** - Exit criteria not met, address issues and reconvene

## Approvals

| Role | Name | Decision | Signature | Date |
|------|------|----------|-----------|------|
| Project Manager | Project Manager | Approve | PM Signature | 2025-05-14 |
| Business Analyst | Business Analyst | Approve | BA Signature | 2025-05-14 |
| Architect | Solution Architect | Approve | Arch Signature | 2025-05-14 |
| Security Architect | Security Architect | Approve | SecArch Signature | 2025-05-14 |
| QA Lead | QA Lead | Approve | QA Signature | 2025-05-14 |

## Notes and Comments
The requirements phase has been completed successfully with all exit criteria met. The project can now proceed to the design phase. Special attention should be given to the identified risks, particularly around security control implementation and legacy system integration. The action items should be addressed early in the design phase to mitigate potential issues.
