## Please note - I need to use the local git repository for a complete commit of all files

The GitHub MCP tools are great for single file operations, but for a comprehensive update of all the changed files in the memory system, it's better to use the local git repository which is already connected to GitHub.

This will allow us to commit all the related changes together with a single meaningful commit message that explains the purpose of the changes.

Please see the actual updates via the git push below.
