# Coding Standards

## General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Write comprehensive tests
- Review code before submission

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and meaningful names
- Follow language-specific naming conventions
- Be consistent with naming patterns
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- Use domain terminology where appropriate

## Code Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (spaces vs. tabs)
- Follow line length guidelines
- Use appropriate spacing
- Group related code blocks
- Organize imports/includes logically
- Follow language-specific style guides

## Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use standardized documentation formats (JSDoc, Javadoc, etc.)

## Error Handling
- Handle all possible error conditions
- Use appropriate error handling mechanisms
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Fail fast and explicitly

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all code
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Write integration tests for component interactions
- Automate testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Security
- Validate all input
- Sanitize output to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Use secure communication protocols

## Performance
- Optimize for readability first, then performance
- Profile before optimizing
- Consider time and space complexity
- Be mindful of resource usage
- Cache appropriately

## Version Control
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use feature branches for development
- Review code before merging
- Follow branching strategy guidelines

## Language-Specific Standards
[Include language-specific standards here based on project requirements]
