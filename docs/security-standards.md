# Security Standards

This document outlines the security standards that all development work must adhere to within the Windsurf Project Template. These standards are based on industry best practices and are designed to ensure that security is built into all aspects of the project from the beginning.

## 1. Secure Development Lifecycle

### 1.1 Security Requirements
- All projects must include explicit security requirements
- Security requirements must be traceable to specific threats
- Requirements must be measurable and testable
- Security requirements must be prioritized based on risk

### 1.2 Threat Modeling
- Threat modeling must be performed for all new features and components
- The STRIDE methodology must be used for threat identification
- Threats must be rated for risk using a consistent methodology
- Mitigations must be identified for all medium, high, and critical risks

### 1.3 Secure Design
- Security architecture must be documented and reviewed
- Defense in depth principles must be applied
- Least privilege principles must be followed
- Secure defaults must be implemented

### 1.4 Secure Coding
- Follow OWASP Top 10 mitigation strategies
- Use approved security libraries and frameworks
- Avoid known vulnerable functions and patterns
- Implement input validation and output encoding

### 1.5 Security Testing
- Automated security testing must be integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Static application security testing (SAST) must be performed
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) must be performed
- Penetration testing must be conducted for major releases

### 1.6 Security Review
- Security code reviews must be conducted by qualified personnel
- Security architecture reviews must be conducted for all designs
- Security findings must be tracked and remediated
- Security metrics must be reported to stakeholders

## 2. Authentication Standards

### 2.1 Password Security
- Minimum length of 12 characters
- Require complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Enforce maximum password age (90 days)
- Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Store passwords using modern hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2id)
- Implement secure password reset mechanisms

### 2.2 Multi-Factor Authentication
- MFA must be available for all user accounts
- MFA must be required for administrative accounts
- MFA must be required for high-risk operations
- MFA implementation must follow NIST 800-63B guidelines

### 2.3 Session Management
- Generate secure, random session identifiers
- Transmit session tokens securely (HTTPS)
- Set appropriate cookie security attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Implement session timeout and absolute session expiration
- Invalidate sessions on security events (password change, etc.)

## 3. Authorization Standards

### 3.1 Access Control
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Apply least privilege principles
- Enforce segregation of duties for sensitive operations
- Implement attribute-based access control for complex scenarios
- Verify authorization on both client and server side

### 3.2 API Security
- Implement proper API authentication
- Apply appropriate rate limiting
- Validate all inputs according to schema
- Log all access and authorization decisions
- Document API security requirements

## 4. Data Protection Standards

### 4.1 Data Classification
- Classify data according to sensitivity
- Apply security controls based on classification
- Document data flows and storage locations
- Implement data minimization principles

### 4.2 Encryption
- Use TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Use AES-256 for data at rest
- Implement proper key management
- Rotate encryption keys regularly
- Secure key storage separate from encrypted data

### 4.3 Data Storage and Retention
- Define and enforce data retention policies
- Implement secure data deletion procedures
- Apply appropriate access controls to stored data
- Backup data securely with encryption

## 5. Secure Coding Standards

### 5.1 Input Validation
- Validate all input on the server side
- Use a positive validation approach (allowlist)
- Validate for type, length, format, and range
- Reject invalid input rather than attempting to sanitize

### 5.2 Output Encoding
- Apply context-appropriate output encoding
- Encode all user-supplied data before output
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Validate all output format and structure

### 5.3 Injection Prevention
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Avoid dynamic code execution
- Use safe APIs for operating system commands
- Properly sanitize file paths and names

### 5.4 Error Handling
- Implement custom error handlers
- Do not expose sensitive information in errors
- Log errors securely with appropriate detail
- Use generic error messages to users

## 6. Logging and Monitoring Standards

### 6.1 Security Logging
- Log all authentication events (success and failure)
- Log all authorization decisions
- Log all administrative actions
- Include contextual information (who, what, when, where, result)
- Do not log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

### 6.2 Log Management
- Protect logs from unauthorized access
- Implement log rotation and retention
- Centralize log collection
- Ensure log integrity

### 6.3 Security Monitoring
- Implement real-time security monitoring
- Create alerts for suspicious activities
- Establish incident response procedures
- Conduct regular log reviews

## 7. Compliance Requirements

### 7.1 Regulatory Compliance
- Document applicable compliance requirements
- Map security controls to compliance requirements
- Conduct regular compliance assessments
- Maintain evidence of compliance

### 7.2 Security Policies
- Document and communicate security policies
- Train team members on security requirements
- Review and update policies regularly
- Enforce policy compliance

## 8. Security Tools and Resources
