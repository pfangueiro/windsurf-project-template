# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the project, including types of tests, tools, and processes.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify individual components work as expected in isolation
- **Scope**: Functions, methods, classes
- **Tools**: [Unit testing frameworks]
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage
- **Responsibility**: Developers

### Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify components work together correctly
- **Scope**: Component interactions, API endpoints, database operations
- **Tools**: [Integration testing frameworks]
- **Coverage Target**: All critical integration points
- **Responsibility**: Developers, QA

### End-to-End Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify complete user flows
- **Scope**: Full application functionality from user perspective
- **Tools**: [E2E testing frameworks]
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user journeys
- **Responsibility**: QA

### Performance Testing
- **Purpose**: Verify system meets performance requirements
- **Scope**: Response times, throughput, resource usage
- **Tools**: [Performance testing tools]
- **Coverage Target**: Critical paths and high-load scenarios
- **Responsibility**: Performance engineers

### Security Testing
- **Purpose**: Identify security vulnerabilities
- **Scope**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Tools**: [Security testing tools]
- **Coverage Target**: All security-critical components
- **Responsibility**: Security engineers

## Testing Process

### Development Testing
1. Developers write unit tests for new code
2. Run tests locally before committing
3. CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically
4. Code review includes test review

### QA Testing
1. QA creates test plans based on requirements
2. Manual testing of new features
3. Automated regression testing
4. Defect reporting and tracking

### Release Testing
1. Full regression test suite execution
2. Performance testing under expected load
3. Security vulnerability scanning
4. User acceptance testing

## Test Environments
- **Development**: Individual developer environments
- **Integration**: Shared environment for integration testing
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final testing
- **Production**: Live environment with monitoring

## Test Data Management
- Use test data generators for consistent data
- Sanitize production data for testing when needed
- Maintain reference datasets for regression testing
- Reset test environments to known state between tests

## Continuous Improvement
- Regular review of test coverage and effectiveness
- Update tests based on defect analysis
- Automate manual tests where possible
- Refine testing process based on team feedback
