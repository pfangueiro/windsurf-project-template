## Usage with Workflow Commands

The integration framework connects all workflow enhancements with the smart MCP configuration:

1. **Start a New Task**
   ```
   /task-lifecycle start "Implement user authentication"
   ```
   This triggers:
   - Memory structure to load relevant context
   - Session intelligence to prepare the environment
   - Smart MCP to select appropriate capabilities

2. **Handle Errors**
   ```
   /error-handling classify "Database connection timeout"
   ```
   This triggers:
   - Error classification and logging
   - Recovery strategy selection
   - MCP tool selection for resolution

3. **Verify Memory Consistency**
   ```
   /memory-consistency verify
   ```
   This triggers:
   - Checksum verification of memory files
   - Inconsistency detection and resolution
   - MCP selection for recovery if needed

4. **Enhance Session Management**
   ```
   /session-intelligence summarize
   ```
   This triggers:
   - Session summary generation
   - Knowledge capture and organization
   - Preparation for next session

## Benefits of Integrated Workflows

This integrated approach delivers significant benefits:

1. **Contextual Intelligence**: All workflows share context for better decision-making
2. **Seamless Tool Selection**: MCP capabilities are selected based on comprehensive context
3. **Learning System**: Successful patterns are captured and reused across workflows
4. **Adaptive Assistance**: The system evolves based on your specific working patterns

By using these workflows together with your smart MCP configuration, you create a powerful environment where the IDE intelligently selects the right tools based on comprehensive context from all sources.
