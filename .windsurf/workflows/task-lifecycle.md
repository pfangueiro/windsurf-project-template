# Task Lifecycle Events

This enhancement implements structured task lifecycle events to improve workflow tracking and automation.

```yaml

  events:
    task_start:
      actions:
        - "Create task log in task-logs/ directory"

## Integration with Smart MCP

Task lifecycle events enrich the smart MCP context in several ways:

1. **Contextual Tool Selection** - Task start events provide the MCP with specific task requirements for optimal tool selection
2. **Progress-Based Adaptation** - In-progress events allow the MCP to adjust tool selection as the task evolves
3. **Quality-Driven Remediation** - Completion events with quality metrics can trigger specific MCP capabilities when remediation is needed

This structured approach ensures the MCP intelligence always has the most relevant task context when selecting tools and capabilities.
