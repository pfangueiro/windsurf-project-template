# Error Handling Framework

This enhancement implements a structured approach to error detection, logging, and recovery.

## Integration with Smart MCP

The error handling framework enhances MCP intelligence in the following ways:

1. **Error-Driven Tool Selection** - When errors occur, the framework provides structured information to the MCP to select the most appropriate recovery tools
2. **Capability Prioritization** - Error classification helps prioritize which MCP capabilities to invoke based on severity and context
3. **Learning Loop** - The framework feeds successful error resolutions back to the MCP to improve future tool selection
4. **Context Preservation** - Detailed error logging maintains context across resolution attempts, enabling more effective MCP operations

This structured approach ensures errors are handled with the optimal combination of tools while building a knowledge base for future prevention.
