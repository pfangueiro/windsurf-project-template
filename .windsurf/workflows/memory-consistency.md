## Integration with Smart MCP

Memory consistency verification enhances smart MCP operations in several ways:

1. **Reliable Context Source** - Verified memory files provide trustworthy context for MCP tool selection
2. **Error Prevention** - Detecting inconsistencies early prevents MCP from acting on incorrect information
3. **Recovery Support** - When inconsistencies are found, the verification system provides structured information to the MCP to select appropriate recovery tools
4. **Learning Persistence** - Ensuring memory integrity across sessions preserves learned MCP patterns and preferences

This structured approach to consistency ensures the MCP intelligence always operates with accurate project context, improving the relevance of selected tools and capabilities.
