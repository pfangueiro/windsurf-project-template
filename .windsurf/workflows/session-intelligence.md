## Integration with Smart MCP

Session intelligence significantly enhances the smart MCP experience in several ways:

1. **Contextual Tool Preparation** - Startup procedures prepare the most relevant MCP tools based on detected session context
2. **Adaptive Tool Selection** - Focus monitoring and drift detection help the MCP adjust tool selection as session needs evolve
3. **Knowledge Preservation** - Session completion activities ensure important context is preserved for future MCP operations
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Cross-session continuity creates a feedback loop that improves MCP tool selection over time

This enhancement ensures that MCP operations are always aligned with session context, improving the relevance and effectiveness of selected tools.
