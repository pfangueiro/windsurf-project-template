# Task management practices
task_management:
  workflow:
    creation:
      - "Create task with clear scope, measurable goals and acceptance criteria"

      - "Identify dependencies and prerequisites"
      - "Assign to appropriate agent(s)"
    execution:
      - "Update activeContext.md with current task focus"
      - "Follow defined process for implementation"
      - "Document progress in real-time"
      - "Report blockers immediately"
    review:
      - "Self-review by implementing agent"
      - "Cross-review by another relevant agent"
      - "Verify against acceptance criteria"
    completion:
      - "Document completion in progress.md"
