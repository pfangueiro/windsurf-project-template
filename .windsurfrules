# Windsurf Project Template Intelligence

This file serves as a learning journal for the Windsurf Project Template, capturing important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that helps work more effectively.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- **Memory Bank Hierarchy**: All changes must follow the hierarchical structure (projectbrief → middle layer → current state layer)
- **Memory Consistency**: When making changes to foundation documents, verify all dependent documents are updated
- **File Recreation Process**: When recreating memory files, always create a backup first and maintain hierarchical dependencies

## User Preferences and Workflow

- **Documentation Style**: Markdown with mermaid diagrams for visualizing processes
- **Update Triggers**: Use "update memory bank" to trigger comprehensive reviews of all files
- **Change Management**: Document all significant changes in activeContext.md and progress.md

## Project-Specific Patterns

- **Three-Layer Documentation**: Foundation layer → Context layer → Current state layer
- **Cross-Reference System**: Each file notes which documents it builds upon and influences
- **Decision Documentation**: All significant decisions tracked in decisionLog.md with rationale and alternatives

## Known Challenges

- **Memory Drift**: Risk of hierarchical documents becoming inconsistent with each other
- **Documentation Debt**: Risk of memory bank becoming outdated if not regularly maintained
- **Workflow Bypass**: Temptation to skip defined processes for expediency

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Memory Bank Structure**: Implemented hierarchical system with foundation document
- **Memory Bank Recreation**: Completed full cleaning and recreation on June 2, 2025
- **Workflow Integration**: In progress - aligning workflows with memory bank structure

## Tool Usage Patterns

- **Memory Update Process**:
  1. Review ALL files
  2. Document current state
  3. Clarify next steps
  4. Update this file

- **Initialization Process**:
  1. Check memory bank exists
  2. Read all memory files
  3. Verify completeness
  4. Plan next actions
