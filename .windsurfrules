# Task management practices
task_management:
  workflow:
    creation:
      - "Create task with clear scope, measurable goals and acceptance criteria"
      - "Estimate task duration (aim for 2 hours max per task)"
      - "Identify dependencies and prerequisites"
      - "Assign to appropriate agent(s)"
      - "Generate unique task ID in format TASK-[number]"
      - "Automatically create test tasks for feature tasks"
    execution:
      - "Update activeContext.md with current task focus"
      - "Follow defined process for implementation"
      - "Document progress in real-time"
      - "Report blockers immediately"
      - "Update task status as work progresses"
    review:
      - "Self-review by implementing agent"
      - "Cross-review by another relevant agent"
      - "Verify against acceptance criteria"
      - "Execute all related tests and verify they pass"
    completion:
      - "Document completion in progress.md"
      - "Update any relevant documentation"
      - "Capture decisions in decisionLog.md"
      - "Update memory bank with UMB command"
      - "Automatically update status of dependent tasks"
      - "Generate completion report"
  documentation:
    task_format:
      - "ID: Unique identifier (TASK-[number])"
      - "Title: Clear, concise description"
      - "Agent: Responsible agent(s)"
      - "Deadline: Expected completion timeframe"
      - "Dependencies: Related tasks or prerequisites"
